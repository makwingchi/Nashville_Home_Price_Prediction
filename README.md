# Home Price Prediction in Nashville, TN

### Description
In this project, we have a dataset "train.and.test_student.csv", which contains the information of home characteristics in Nashville, TN, such as home sale price, acres of land, the number of rooms, and whether it is supported by air conditioning. I also collected other variables available on [Nashville Open Data Portal](https://data.nashville.gov/). The goal here is to use linear regression model to predict home sale price in Nashville, TN.
